#Selection problem:

Given n elements that are different from each other, where each element contains a key and data, it is necessary to find the element with the K size 
(The element that there are exactly k-1 elements with keys which are smaller).
Assumption: All keys are different!

###The purpose of the project is to implement several solutions to the selection problem:

1. Selection algorithm with random pivot
2. Binary minimum stack
3. Binary search tree
